*This article is a deep-dive from JudyAI Lab — an AI engineering playbook series with 100+ published guides, 5,000+ weekly readers across 60+ countries, focused on the practical side of running AI agents, trading systems, and content pipelines in production.*

AI agents are spending real money — and most of it is going through RapidAPI, Stripe, or straight into the void of custom billing code. If you have an AI, data, or utility API, there's a faster way to reach this emerging buyer class: **list it on AgenticTrade**.

This guide gets you from zero to live listing in under 5 minutes. No credit card. No billing infrastructure. No 6-week integration project.

## Why AgenticTrade?

Before we touch the keyboard, here's the business case in three numbers:

| Platform | Commission | First Month |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Apple App Store | 30% | 30% |
| RapidAPI | 25% | 25% |
| **AgenticTrade** | **10%** | **0%** |

**AgenticTrade charges 60% less than RapidAPI** — and your first month is completely free. You keep 100% of your revenue while agents discover and pay for your service automatically.

The platform handles:
- **Discovery** — MCP-native service registry, searchable by agents and humans alike
- **Payment** — Multi-rail support: USDC (x402), 300+ crypto tokens (NOWPayments), fiat (PayPal)
- **Metering** — Per-call tracking with real-time usage analytics
- **Reputation** — Automated quality scoring (latency, uptime, reliability) that builds over time

You write the API. We handle everything else.

---

## Prerequisites

- An API you want to monetize (AI model endpoint, data feed, tool service, etc.)
- An AgenticTrade account (free at [agentictrade.io](https://agentictrade.io))
- curl, or any HTTP client

That's it.

---

## Step 1: Register and Get Your API Key

Sign up at [agentictrade.io](https://agentictrade.io) and navigate to **Dashboard → API Keys → New Key**.

Copy your `acf_live_xxx` key. It follows this format:

```
acf_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

## Step 2: Register Your Service

Register your API with a single `POST` call. Here's a real example — suppose you're selling a cryptocurrency sentiment API at $0.01 per call:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentictrade.io/api/v1/services \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer acf_live_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Crypto Sentiment API",
    "description": "Real-time social sentiment scores for 500+ crypto assets, powered by NLP analysis of Twitter, Reddit, and Telegram.",
    "base_url": "https://api.yourservice.com/v1",
    "price_per_call": 0.01,
    "currency": "USD",
    "payment_rail": "x402",
    "category": "data",
    "tags": ["crypto", "sentiment", "nlp", "trading"],
    "documentation_url": "https://docs.yourservice.com"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "svc_4a8f2c1d9e3b",
  "name": "Crypto Sentiment API",
  "status": "active",
  "price_per_call": 0.01,
  "commission_rate": 0.0,
  "commission_rate_note": "Month 1: 0% commission — keep 100% of revenue",
  "marketplace_url": "https://agentictrade.io/marketplace/svc_4a8f2c1d9e3b",
  "created_at": "2026-03-20T13:00:00Z"
  }
```

Your service is **live**. The platform assigned it a unique ID (`svc_xxx`) and set your commission rate to 0% for the first month automatically.

---

## Step 3: Create a Second API Key for the Proxy

This is where it gets powerful. Instead of giving buyers your raw API endpoint, AgenticTrade proxies your requests through its own infrastructure. This means:

- Buyers never see your real URL (security + rate limiting)
- Payment is handled automatically before your endpoint is called
- Usage is metered transparently

Create a key specifically for proxy access:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentictrade.io/api/v1/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer acf_live_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Proxy Key — Sentiment API",
    "scopes": ["proxy:svc_4a8f2c1d9e3b"],
    "rate_limit": 300
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "key_7f2d9a3c1e8b",
  "key": "acp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "name": "Proxy Key — Sentiment API",
  "scopes": ["proxy:svc_4a8f2c1d9e3b"],
  "rate_limit": 300,
  "created_at": "2026-03-20T13:02:00Z"
}
```

This proxy key is what you give to buyers. They use it to call your service through AgenticTrade's proxy endpoint.

---

## Step 4: (Optional) Create an MCP Tool Descriptor

If you want AI agents to discover your service natively (via MCP — Model Context Protocol), register a tool descriptor:

```bash
curl -X POST https://agentictrade.io/api/v1/mcp/tools \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer acf_live_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "service_id": "svc_4a8f2c1d9e3b",
    "name": "get_crypto_sentiment",
    "description": "Get real-time sentiment score for a cryptocurrency asset. Returns a -100 (extremely bearish) to +100 (extremely bullish) score.",
    "input_schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "symbol": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Crypto asset symbol, e.g. BTC, ETH, SOL"
        },
        "timeframe": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": ["1h", "24h", "7d"],
          "default": "24h"
        }
      },
      "required": ["symbol"]
    },
    "output_schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "symbol": {"type": "string"},
        "sentiment_score": {"type": "number"},
        "confidence": {"type": "number"},
        "sources_analyzed": {"type": "integer"}
      }
    }
  }'
```

Now any AI agent built with Claude, GPT, or any MCP-compatible framework can discover and call your tool natively.

## How Buyers Call Your Service

From the buyer's perspective, calling your service through AgenticTrade looks like this:

```bash
# Buyer calls your service via the AgenticTrade proxy
curl -X POST https://agentictrade.io/api/v1/proxy/svc_4a8f2c1d9e3b/sentiment \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer acp_buyer_proxy_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbol": "BTC", "timeframe": "24h"}'

# Response from your API is returned as-is:
# {
#   "symbol": "BTC",
#   "sentiment_score": 42,
#   "confidence": 0.87,
#   "sources_analyzed": 18420
# }
```

The platform handles the payment header (`X-ACF-Amount`, `X-ACF-Free-Tier`, etc.) automatically. Your endpoint just returns data.

---

## Your Revenue Dashboard

Track earnings in real time:

```bash
curl https://agentictrade.io/api/v1/settlements \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer acf_live_your_key_here"
```

```json
{
  "total_revenue": 847.32,
  "total_calls": 84732,
  "pending_settlement": 12.50,
  "last_payout": {
    "amount": 234.82,
    "currency": "USDC",
    "timestamp": "2026-03-15T00:00:00Z"
  },
  "commission_history": [
    {"month": "2026-01", "rate": "0%", "revenue": 0.00},
    {"month": "2026-02", "rate": "5%", "revenue": 38.47},
    {"month": "2026-03", "rate": "10%", "revenue": 808.85}
  ]
}
```

Settlements go out in USDC on Base network, automatically, with no manual invoicing.

## Commission Schedule: What You Actually Pay

The **Provider Growth Program** is designed so you pay less when you're starting out:

| Period | Commission | You Keep |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Month 1 | **0%** | 100% |
| Months 2–3 | **5%** | 95% |
| Month 4 onwards | **10%** | 90% |

Compare that to RapidAPI: you pay 25% from day one, with no graduation.

At $1,000/month in API revenue:
- **RapidAPI**: you keep $750
- **AgenticTrade (Month 4+)**: you keep $900
- **Your savings**: $150/month = $1,800/year

---

## What's Included in the Platform

Here's what you get for that 10% (or 5%, or 0%):

| Feature | Included |
|---------|----------|
| Service listing + discovery | ✅ |
| MCP tool registry | ✅ |
| Multi-rail payment (crypto + fiat) | ✅ |
| Per-call metering + analytics | ✅ |
| Reputation engine (latency, uptime, reliability scores) | ✅ |
| Automatic USDC settlements | ✅ |
| Rate limiting + SSRF protection | ✅ |
| Webhook notifications (payment.completed, service.called) | ✅ |
| Team management + routing rules | ✅ |
| 24/7 proxy infrastructure | ✅ |

You don't have to build any of this. It's baked into the platform.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to integrate the x402 protocol myself?**
No. AgenticTrade handles payment protocol negotiation server-side. You just return your API response; the platform injects the billing headers.

**Q: What if my API is expensive to run?**
You're in control of pricing. Set `price_per_call` to whatever covers your infrastructure cost plus margin. The platform takes a percentage — it doesn't cap your earning potential.

**Q: Can I delist my service anytime?**
Yes. One API call to deactivate. No lock-in, no penalties.

**Q: What's the settlement timeline?**
Weekly automatic payouts in USDC. Enterprise providers can request custom payout schedules.
